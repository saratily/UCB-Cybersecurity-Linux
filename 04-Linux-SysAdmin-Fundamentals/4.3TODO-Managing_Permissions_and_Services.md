## Overview
- Inspect and set file permissions for sensitive files on the system.
- Manage and monitor services on the system, and remove unused services.
- Create and assign users for services.

## Access Controls
    |_ everything in linux is file (item)
    |_ grant permission to access documents and files on a host.
```
Item
    User - item owner - can be changed
    Group - primary group associated with the creator - can be changed
    Other - Everyone else - who is not owner or group
```

### DAC - Discretionary Access Control
    |_ Assigning item permissions is called DAC.
    |_ It is discretionary because item permissions can pass from one subject to
another
    |_ much easier to implement and maintain as users can manage access to the data they own.
    |_ However, DAC isn't good enough for protecting sensitive records

### MAC - Mandatory Access Control
    |_ controlled by administrators and requires lots of time and effort to maintain, but it provides a high level of security.
    |_ usually used in military, govt.

### DEMO - Permissions
In the upcoming demo, weï¿½ll create a file and a directory, observing default permissions. Then, we will change the permissions to deny certain groups and users access. 

ls -l - show file (item) permissions
chmod - to change file permission
chown - to change file ownership

```
# Create a file
$ touch my_file.txt

# Create a directory
$ mkdir my_dir

#  show file (item) permissions
blue = directory, white=regular file, green=executable
$ ls -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Apr  7 14:37 my_dir
d               -> it is a directory
rwx             -> owner permissions
r-x             -> group permissions
r-x             -> other permissions 
2               -> no. of files/links
sysadmin        -> owner
sysadmin        -> group 
4096            -> size
Apr  7 14:37    -> date and time
my_dir          -> directory name

-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin    0 Apr  7 14:36 my_file.txt
-               -> not a directory
rw-             -> owner permissions
r--             -> group permissions
r--             -> other permissions 
1               -> no. of files
sysadmin        -> owner
sysadmin        -> group 
0               -> size
Apr  7 14:36    -> date and time
my_file.txt     -> directory name

$ chmod 777 my_file.txt
$ $ ls -l
-rwxrwxrwx 1 sysadmin sysadmin    0 Jun  1 14:36 my_file.txt

# change owner & group to root -> sudo chown <user>:<group> <item>
# following all 3 are same:
$ sudo chown root:root my_file.txt
OR
$sudo chown root: my_file.txt
OR
$sudo chown :root my_file.txt
# if user or group doesn't exist, then error: invalid user

# Change ownership recursively - everything under my_dir
$ sudo chown -R :instructor my_dir
```

#### Symbolic notation
```
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=w my_file.txt
# no space b/w u=rwx,g=rw,o=w

$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=--- my_file.txt
same as 
$ sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o= my_file.txt

# having execuable on dir means can run cmd on that dir, e.g. ls and cd, etc.


# Completely shutdown Documents directory
$ chmod u=rw my_dir/

$ ls -l
total 4
drw-r-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jun  1 16:10 my_dir
-rwxrw---- 1 sysadmin sysadmin    0 Jun  1 14:36 my_file.txt
my_dir  my_file.txt

$ cd my_dir/
bash: cd: my_dir/: Permission denied

$ ls my_dir/
ls: cannot access 'my_dir/abc': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'my_dir/xyx': Permission denied
abc  xyx

# owner , group and other can't cd or ls in Documents, except root
$ sudo su       -> work as root
```

#### chmod using numbers
```
0 -> no permission
1 -> executable (x) 
2 -> write (w)
4 -> read (r)

sudo chmod UGO <item>
# good for security -> u=rwx g=rw only
$ sudo chmod 760 my_file.txt 

# can change permission on hidden files
$ sudo chmod 400 .ssh
# change .ssh to read only by owner
OR
$ sudo chmod 500 .ssh
# change .ssh to read and execute, only by owner
```

#### Chmod using alphabet notion
```
# Create a new file
$ touch new_file.txt    -> -rw-r--r--

# Change executable for all
$ suod chmod +x new_file.txt    -> -rwxr-xr-x

# Remove executable for all
$ sudo chmod -x new_file.txt    -> -rw-r--r--

-
```

### ACTIVITY - 03_Permissions
In this activity, you will inspect and set file permissions on a few of the most sensitive items on a Linux system. 

Your senior administrator has asked you to complete the following:

1. Set permissions on /etc/shadow to allow only root read and write access, i.e. 600
```
$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 2888 Oct 21  2022 /etc/shadow
i.e 640 permission

$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw------- 1 root shadow 2888 Oct 21  2022 /etc/shadow
```

2. Set permissions on /etc/gshadow to allow only root read and write access. i.e. 600
```
$ ls -l /etc/gshadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 2888 Oct 21  2022 /etc/gshadow
i.e 640 permission

$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

$ ls -l /etc/gshadow
-rw------- 1 root shadow 2888 Oct 21  2022 /etc/gshadow

```
3. Set permissions on /etc/group to allow root read and write access, and all others read access only.
```
$ $ ls -l /etc/group
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1303 Oct 21  2022 /etc/group
i.e 644 permission

$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

$ ls -l /etc/group
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1303 Oct 21  2022 /etc/group

```
4. Set permissions on /etc/passwd to allow root read and write access, and all others read access only.
```
$ ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3214 Oct 21  2022 /etc/passwd

$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

$ ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3214 Oct 21  2022 /etc/passwd
```

Bonus
5. Verify all accounts have passwords.
```
$ sudo grep root /etc/shadow
root:!:18212:0:99999:7:::
# root user doesn't have a password.

# grep all the users that does not have password
$ sudo grep "!" /etc/shadow
root:!:18212:0:99999:7:::
speech-dispatcher:!:18113:0:99999:7:::
vboxadd:!:18212::::::

# each account has a password hash and not a ! in the second field of each listing in the /etc/shadow file. ! indicates that there is no password set for that user.
```

6. Recall that if any user has the UID of 0, the system thinks they are root. Verify that no users have UID of 0 besides root. If you find one that does, change the user's UID to any value greater than 1000.
```
$ grep "x:0" /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

7. Provide a list of all permission changes that you make in a text file in your research directory.
```
```

## Managing services
    |_ A service is a function or capability that a machine makes available to another
    |_ e.g. file-sharing services allow computers to send and receive dat                t adcf d
    |_ gmail, google drive
    |_ local services - e.g. Tripwire - can be installed like program ed
    

### DEMO - Finding and Stopping SMB
### ACTIVITY - 07_Managing_Services
Your senior administrator wants you to audit the services being run by the server and shut down old and unused services.



### DEMO - Setting up and Adding Service
### ACTIVITY - 10_Service_Users

Your senior administrator would like you to remove any old service users from the system and create a new user dedicated to running Tripwire.
- Use adduser and deluser with the correct flags to clean up the system and create this new Tripwire user.
- Tripwire can only be run as root , so you must add a line to the sudoers file to allow this.
